    Motion is a framework that enables LLM pipeline developers to define and incrementally maintain self-updating prompts in Python.
    
    **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a mode of exploration** to either (as an end-user) interact with a Motion-powered application or (as a developer) explore summaries of user feedback and external context incrementally maintained by Motion.
    
    ### Be an End-User: Explore our AI Stylist Application
    - Our AI stylist application takes into consideration some basic information about you and suggests items to buy for events of your choice.
    - You can toggle between using Motion's summaries and not using them to see the difference in the quality of recommendations and the speed of the application. 
    - Using Motion uses summaries of your feedback and external context in prompts to suggest items to buy for your specific event.
    - Not using Motion simply uses *all* content retrieved by RAG (previous recommendations to avoid, your feedback/what you like or dislike, Fashion trends from Google News, etc.) in the prompt.
    ### Be a Developer: Explore Summaries Used as Prompt Sub-Parts and Real-Time Prompt Updates
    - Explore the summaries incrementally maintained by Motion. There is a global summary of fashion trends (used for all users' prompts) and user-specific summaries of feedback and their query history.
    - You can select a user to inspect their summaries.
    - You can see the news articles that are used to generate the global summary (it is updated every 10 minutes).
    - You can see a timeline of user interactions (that will be used to update the user-specific summaries).
